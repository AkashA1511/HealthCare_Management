# Decentralized Healthcare Data Management System

## Aim
Develop a blockchain-based platform that allows individuals to securely store and manage their healthcare records while giving them full control over who can access their data. This innovative medical record storage app gives patients complete control over their data, with secure global access anytime. It includes a data entry form and authorized access for patients. Using Solidity smart contracts, it stores patient information on the Ethereum blockchain securely.

## Problem Statement
In traditional healthcare systems, patients often face challenges in accessing and managing their medical records. These records are typically scattered across various healthcare providers, making it difficult for patients to maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of their health history. Additionally, concerns about data privacy and security persist, as centralized databases are vulnerable to breaches and unauthorized access.

To address these issues, there is a need for a decentralized medical record management system that empowers patients to input, access, and control their health information securely. Such a system should ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and accessibility while complying with relevant healthcare regulations.
